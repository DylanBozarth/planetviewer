work in progress- Planet viewing app 
// currently stuck on: 
json data

issues: 
Planet view looks bad, should all be the same
exo planets orbit is wonky for some reason
Lets try redux soon

Load screenwould be good

phase 3: 
1. better ui -- possibly sidebar 
3. scanning and probe features 
4. good sounds too




side ideas: 
1. asteroid belt 
2. visit moons
